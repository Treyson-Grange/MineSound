# Ladies! Gentlemen! Both, and neither!

This is the dumbest thing I have ever programmed. Be warned.

I am in a big minecraft mood currently, and I constantly forget, Minecraft is terrifying. So many erie sounds that keep me on my toes. It keeps me attentive. Minecraft keeps my attention for hours on end, and with my ADHD like brain, that is impressive. I theorize that this effect comes from the soundtrack. (the sound design in general.) If I can keep the same attentive prowess in my minecraft playthrough, while I, I don't know, work? I think I will reach new levels of productivity.

This idea led to this program. I decided it had to be a command line application. No real reason. Fun intro to golang tho. Also a super fun spooky season project. Happy Halloween!

## Installation

The scariest thing of all! No installation instructions! ooooooOOoooooOOOooooh you're shaking out of fear, I know. ðŸ‘»

## Instructions

- `run go . <min_in_sec> <max_in_sec>`
  - Override for randomization is necessary if you want more time between sounds.
  - By default, it is fast intervals, for the sake of showcase.
- Headphones on, sound up.
- Use the arrow keys to explore your options.
- Select an option with enter.
- Feel free to change your selection at any time.
